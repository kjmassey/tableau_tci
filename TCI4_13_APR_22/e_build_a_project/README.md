# Let's stand up a typical project!
---
This module will combine many of the types of methods we have seen so far. We will simulate creating a very basic 'real world' project from scratch. This module will only use TSC to do all of the following sequentially:

#### - Create a project on Tableau Server
#### - Create a server group to controll access
#### - Assign members/permissions to the new group
#### - Publish a workbook
#### - Refresh the extract in the new workbook
